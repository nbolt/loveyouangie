We share a similar sense of fun and adventure.
She's incredibly cute.
omg she loves kpop more than I do
She's amazingly honest with herself, and challenges me to do the same.
She gives me the conviction I need to move forward.
We're working towards so many awesome things together it's hard to contain my excitement sometimes.
Because she's just so crazy over me, too :3
She makes me feel safe and secure.
She's fun to be around no matter where we are or what we're doing.
She's smart, creative, curious, and imaginative.
Somehow every meal we share is the best I've ever had.
We are rebels and vagabonds.
She never gives up on me.
She's my best friend.
Because I just do. Deal with it!
I wouldn't have a home without her.
